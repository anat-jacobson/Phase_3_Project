    "# Tanzania Water Wells\n",
    "Predicting the operating condition of water wells in Tanzania based on variaous predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "By: Anat Jacobson \n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on data on the on the makeup and condition of wells within Tanzania. The data is used to create a predictive model and provide valuable insights into whether a well is in operating or not. This can aid the Tanzanian Government in deciding which wells neeed to be visited first in order to repair and aid in the major water crisis the country is facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction and Busines Case\n",
    "The problem being faced is that there are thousands of water wells within Tanzania and many of need reparations. This is a major issue within Tanzania since wells are the main water source, so lacking functional wells is a severe threat to livelihood. Water scarcity is also effecting livestock, wild animals, fishing, and other living organisms. Additionally, as you know there has been fast population growth within the country, climate change impacts and expansion of human economic activities put the country under water supply distress. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue here is that inspecting these wells cost a lot of money and takes loads of time that Tanzania does not have. I have created a model with the goal in mind to predict which wells in Tanzania are no longer functional and therefore are the ones that should be visited first and repaired.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this notebook has been provided by:  Taarifa and Tanzania Ministry of Water through <a href=\"https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/\" >Driven Data</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Understandings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "- Tanzanian Goverment can make informed decision when deciding which well to look at to repair next and save money\n",
    "- Well builders may be able to make better decisions when building and repairing wells  wells to build with parts that don't lead to breakage as much.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data \n",
    "The dataset that was worked with after cleaning had over 53K wells in it with data that focused on the geographical information of the well as well as information of water source, payments, quality of water and other important features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive measure in this set was whether the well is functional or not, positive being functional. The measure was initially in a seperate dataframe but was merged with the rest of the data to be able to accurately create a model. This cleaning and merging process is explained below. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few key metrics taken into account from this dataset were: \n",
    "\n",
    "- 5 Different quality groups of water\n",
    "- 26 regions\n",
    "- 1.8K funders\n",
    "- 7 Source types\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the predictive measure was initailly a tirtiary measure and I changed it to binary that will be explained below as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "Because of the many categorical features that can influence well functionality pricing, this project investigates features and their effects through various types of models in an attempt to best predict the well condition. This is done through the use of logistic regression, decision trees and random forest. Our predictor for this model is whether the well is functioning or not, positive class being functional. Our measure for this project will be based on the highest f1 score since for the purposes of this project, we not only care whether the prediction is positive cases but also whether they are accurately positive and whether negative results are accurately negative. \n",
